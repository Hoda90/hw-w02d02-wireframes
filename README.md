Tonight for homework you will be creating wireframes for your final project. This is a JS course, not HTML/CSS or UX course, and you will not be graded on "how pretty" your product is. That being said, it is important to think through the structure of your site. Making wireframes now will help you decide where everything will go so you can focus on the JavaScript! 

A wireframe is an image that sketches out the layout of major pieces of content within a page, without all of the fully-rendered detail. Although making detailed, feature-rich wireframes is typically the province of the UX/UI designer, even developers can produce basic layout sketches, and these sketches are extremely useful in the planning process as a tool to clarify and codify your vision. They also segue easily into mocking up a site with boxes, so that you know how to actually build your layout.

You are welcome to create your wireframe using any tool you wish. You can even draw it by hand (as long as it provides detail). Some tools you can use are [Wireframe CC](https://wireframe.cc/) or [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) We suggest using a tool called [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files).

### Figma Tips

- Always work within a frame
- Have a frame for every state of your app
- Name your frames in the right side bar 
- Use shapes and text to layout your page within the frame
  - if you need some fake text, try using [lorum](https://www.lipsum.com/)
- Copy paste repeated elements between frames (like nav bars)
- Add interaction between elements with the prototype tab on the right hand side
  - Select item
  - trigger: what it should react to (usually on click)
  - action: where you want to go (the name of the frame to go to)

  Open an issue on [this repository](https://github.com/js-penguins/hw-w02d02-wireframes) that has the following:
  - A link to your wireframes or images of your wireframes
  - A description of your wireframes and how a user will interact with your site
